## Overview

GuardianCruise is a two-fold project that addresses both the **pre-crash** and **post-crash** scenarios. The pre-crash phase involves facial analysis using OpenCV to detect signs of distracted driving and suspicious behaviors. In the post-crash phase, the project aims to provide care and assistance.

## Features

1. **Pre-crash Monitoring:**
   - Facial analysis using OpenCV.
   - Detection of distracted driving and suspicious behaviors.
   - Voice prompt in the maternal tone cautioning against distracted behavior.

2. **Post-crash Assistance:**
   - Sending emails and text messages to the driver's parents.
   - Alerting law enforcement and other relevant authorities.
   - Capturing an image post-crash.
   - Describing the scenario to parents and law enforcement.

3. **Machine Learning Integration:**
   - Recognition of patterns associated with mood changes, impairment, and specific activities like phone usage or conversation.

GuardianCruise utilizes OpenCV for facial feature detection, including eye tracking and yawning detection. The collected data is then fed into a machine learning model trained to recognize patterns associated with mood changes, impairment, and specific activities.
